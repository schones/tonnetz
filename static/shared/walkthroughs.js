 * walkthroughs.js
 * ===============
 * Guided walkthrough sequences for the Tonnetz Explorer.
 *
 * Each walkthrough is a named entry with:
 *   title   — display name for the walkthrough
 *   song    — song/source attribution (shown small on the card)
 *   key     — tonal center of the walkthrough (e.g. "C", "G", "Am")
 *             Used to set the Explorer's key context and as a hint for
 *             chord resolution of ambiguous voicings.
 *   seeAlso — optional { label, href } shown on the final step as a nudge
 *             to a related game/tool, e.g. { label: "Chord Walks", href: "/games/chord-walks" }
 *   steps[] — ordered steps, each with:
 *     chord              — chord name string, e.g. "F", "Em", "A7", "Dm"
 *     title              — short bold heading for this step
 *     body               — 1-2 sentence explanation (conversational, no jargon)
 *     autoPlay           — if true, play the chord on entering this step (default false)
 *     highlightTransform — optional "P", "R", or "L" to show a PLR transform arrow
 *     focus              — optional panel(s) to emphasize: "tonnetz", "keyboard",
 *                          "wheel", "fretboard". String or array of strings.
 *                          Other panels are dimmed. Omit to show all panels normally.
 *
 * Chord names are parsed the same way the Explorer URL deep-links work:
 *   "F" → F major, "Em" → E minor, "A7" → A major (triad), "Dm" → D minor, etc.
