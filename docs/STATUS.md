# SongLab Project Status

**Last updated:** 2026-05-05
**Branch:** `dev` (active — Cantor v1 shipped through 6B; audio-onset-analysis branch holds Phase 1 of the audio rebuild) · `main` (prod)
**Deploy:** Railway from `main`
**Active roadmap:** `docs/songlab-build-plan.md` (v4) + `docs/cantor-design.md` + `docs/audio-architecture.md`
**Platform name:** SongLab · SkratchLab (rebrand complete)


## Current state (2026-05-05)

### Cantor — current state

**Landed and verified on dev:**
- Prompts 1–5 (route, on-screen keyboard, MIDI input, MusicalEventStream singleton, split-point input model)
- 6A: 3D torus migration (12×4 toroidal lattice, 48 nodes, 4 PC instances each)
- 6A.1: constellation wash-vertex snap fix
- 6A.2: chord-detection Hardware-state gating
- 6B: per-frame rotY drift (1 rev / 45s) + torusMajorR breathing (±5%, 8s sine)
- Test track infrastructure: `tests/generate_cantor_test_track.py` +
  `tests/cantor-test-track.md`. WAV regenerable from script (gitignored).

**Landed on branch `audio-onset-analysis` (not yet on dev):**
- Additional audio work (onset-driven analysis rebuild — replaces
  chroma-template chord detection's foundational limitation that it
  cannot distinguish a single note's overtone series from a real
  chord). Phase 1 of the Cantor migration is on this branch.
- Branch state captured separately on the branch's own STATUS.md.
  Lands on dev when ready to merge as a unit.

**In progress:**
- (none on dev — Cantor work is paused on dev while
  `audio-onset-analysis` matures.)

**Open / deferred:**
- Constellation z-fade vs hard occlusion on torus back side.
- 3D math helper deduplication (`_uvToXYZ`, `_rotate3D`,
  `_projectOrtho` are duplicated between cantor-view.js and
  harmonograph-view.js; shared-utility extraction flagged TODO).
- Tempo/beat-driven breathing (replace wall-clock `_elapsed`
  accumulator with a musical-time signal — one-line swap).
- Melody trails: connecting lines between consecutive constellation
  glyphs to expose phrase contour. Needs its own design doc; even
  more interesting on the 3D torus.
- `activeTriads`-clears-mid-phrase anchor snap-back: cosmetic, low
  priority. Fix is to keep last anchor for ~1–2× decay τ after
  `activeTriads` empties.
- Scales on the Tonnetz: separate design thread
  (`docs/scale-regions.md` to be drafted). Not blocking Cantor v1.
- Chladni backdrop dynamics (separate brainstorming thread).
- Build plan review and consolidation across SongLab surfaces —
  flagged as a candidate for a dedicated planning session.

**After Cantor v1 ships:**
- v1 user testing.
- Audio chord-detection silence-watcher tuning if needed.
- `chordChange` dispatch on MusicalEventStream (currently skipped
  as redundant; revisit if a use case emerges).


### Cantor v1 working state

Capability inventory of what's currently shipping on dev:

- /cantor route, on-screen keyboard, MIDI input, Tone.js playback
- MusicalEventStream singleton; on-screen keyboard publishes too
- Tonnetz substrate, canonical orientation (12×4 toroidal lattice
  in 3D mode; 7×5 lattice in 2D mode, regression-free)
- Chord wash with cross-fade, quality-colored fills, hue shifts for
  7ths, (rootPC, baseQuality) diff key for flash-on-quality-change
- Melody constellation, anchored to active wash centroid, with
  exponential decay, velocity → brightness, chord-quality color
- Constellation snap to wash vertices: melody glyphs snap to the
  wash triangle vertex matching their PC. Verified via deterministic
  `cantorView._testSnap` and live Launchkey play.
- User-controllable split-point line (drag, snap, persist) with
  default at MIDI 72 (C5, mid-keyboard)
- Audio chord auto-detection — wash + flash + extension hue all
  driven from live audio when Hardware is active
- Chord-detection respects Hardware state: won't run when Hardware
  is "No audio input", so manual `setTriad` is authoritative on the
  MIDI-only path
- 3D torus rendering (mode3D=true) with per-frame rotY drift
  (1 rev / 45s) and torusMajorR breathing (±5%, 8s sine). Pause
  freezes both; resume produces no jump.
- `window.cantorView` exposed on localhost for dev convenience

## Current Focus

The active workstream on `dev` is **Cantor v1**. Through April 27–28, prompts 1–6B landed and are verified end-to-end on dev: 3D torus surface, per-frame rotY drift + torusMajorR breathing, chord-detection Hardware-state gating, and constellation snap to wash vertices. A deterministic test-track generator (`tests/generate_cantor_test_track.py`) and section-by-section diagnostic doc were also landed for ongoing audio-pipeline validation.

Cantor surfaced a foundational limitation in `chord-detection.js`: chroma-template matching cannot distinguish a single sustained note's overtone series from a real chord, producing false-positive chord washes on solo melody. Rather than patch in place, we forked off `audio-onset-analysis` to rebuild on onset-driven analysis — onsets are the right primitive, since chord and melody are both interpretations of the onset stream. That branch holds Phase 1 of the rebuild and is intentionally not on `dev` yet; it lands when ready to merge as a unit. Phase 2 of the Cantor migration is the next active priority on `dev`, gated on that merge.

Harmonograph (`/harmonograph`, formerly `/art`) is parked on dev at Stage 2: audio-reactive Y-spin and centripetal morph are wired and validated end-to-end against a deterministic test track (`tests/harmonograph-test-track.wav`), with seven audio-pipeline bugs fixed in the same April 24 session. Real-music tuning ("Montreal") and Stage 1.5 multi-torus stacking are deferred while Cantor takes focus.

Approaching Cantor v1 user-testing readiness once the audio-onset-analysis branch lands and Phase 2 ships.


**Next priorities (active):**
1. **Cantor Phase 2 migration** — onset-driven chord/melody analysis. Currently being built on branch `audio-onset-analysis`; lands on `dev` when the branch is ready to merge as a unit. Gates Cantor v1 user testing.
2. **SkratchLab "Clear All"** — should also reset canvas (not just blocks).
3. **Polyrhythm Trainer → nav dropdown + landing page.**

**Backlog:**
- **Real-audio Harmonograph tuning ("Montreal"):** tune `rmsDbFloor` / `rmsDbCeiling` / `spinSignalExponent` against Allison Russell "Montreal" — opening-minute-to-gospel-chorus arc as the calibration target.
- **Harmonograph Stage 1.5 (multi-torus stacking):** multiple concentric/offset toruses for harmonic-layer depth. Open design questions: stack spacing, master-vs-per-torus morph sliders, dynamic spacing as morph rises. After Stage 1.5: `audio-input.js` refactor (fix feedback loop by routing source to analyser only), particle reactivity in 3D, painter's-algorithm depth sort if self-occlusion artifacts surface.
- **Harmonograph Phase 2 design pass:** unified design conversation for three deferred ideas — multi-axis torus spin (Tonnetz-aware mapping of P5/M3/m3 chord-root motion to X/Y/Z), shimmer overlay (non-tonal audio → gold Chladni-pattern particles), and "music has color, noise is gray" saturation principle (flatness-driven desaturation across all visualizations). Worth `docs/multi-axis-spin.md`, `docs/shimmer-design.md`, `docs/color-confidence.md` design docs before building.
- **Linus and Lucy walkthrough** (connects from Polyrhythm Trainer).
- **Tab-audio capture experiment:** feed YouTube into `/harmonograph`.
- **Decide `/harmonograph` front-door** (linked from nav, footer, hidden, or remain unlinked sandbox).
- **Onboarding & tutorial UX** — guided tour / tooltip-card system: friendly intro modals on first visit (Studio, Explorer, Games, `/harmonograph`), short walkthroughs explaining what each tool is for, dedicated tutorials for the generative-art side (why the torus is the natural representation for a Tonnetz, how chord-triangles work, what the FFT is showing). Reference inspirations: BandLab's onboarding modals. Could leverage existing walkthrough infrastructure from Explorer.
- **Original starburst Resonance preset** — preserve original April 19 aesthetic as a named baked-in preset alongside the sparkler defaults.
- **Onset detection wired into Resonance** for staccato burst behavior (separate from Cantor's onset rebuild).
- **Business model / monetization spec.**
- **game-flow.js + adaptive engine extraction** (spec: `docs/game-engine-spec.md`).
- **SkratchLab lightweight DAW** — song presets, chord loops + rhythm, melody play-over.
- **Code review follow-ups:** consolidate triplicated chord-type registries (transforms.js / chord-resolver.js / chord-detection.js); replace `_suppressAutoPlay` with source-tagged HarmonyState.update().
- **AudioWorklet migration for `pitch-detection.js`:** ScriptProcessorNode is deprecated in Chrome. Tracked in `docs/audio-architecture.md` Open Question 1. Not urgent — generous deprecation timeline.
- **Test track v2:** replace pink-noise staircase with chord-velocity staircase. Top-16 RMS is biased toward tonal content (correct for music), so noise isn't the right calibration signal.
- **Hardware dropdown dedup:** Chrome exposes both "Default - X" alias and canonical "X". Cosmetic.
- **User testing prep (15–20 participants).**
- **Educational content idea:** Chladni patterns (Ernst Chladni 1787, founder of modern acoustics). History piece or standing-wave physics piece. Ties into shimmer design and platform-wide "music has shape" positioning.
- **Build plan review and consolidation** — Cantor + Harmonograph integration into the broader SongLab educational story (scales, keys, theory) deserves a dedicated planning session.

## What's Working



### Tonnetz Explorer ✅ fully restyled + Spectrum + MIDI + Resonance + Audio Interface
- DAW-style dark theme at `/explorer`: transport controls, song info bar, walkthrough sidebar
- Tabbed panel area: Tonnetz / Chord Wheel / Fretboard / **Rhythm** / **Spectrum** / **Resonance** (all wired and synchronized via HarmonyState)
- **Spectrum tab (Harmonic Resonance):** real-time FFT particle visualizer, particles colored by chord function, spectral envelope with peak-hold
- **Resonance tab (new):** radial FFT spectrum visualization on Tonnetz grid. Each active node renders the spectrum wrapped in a circle — frequency → angle, magnitude → radius. HarmonyState gates which nodes render, FFT drives how they look. Particles spawn from peaks, radiate outward. Fullscreen toggle.
- **Audio interface support:** Hardware UI (device dropdown, status, quality badge). Scarlett 2i2 auto-detect. External audio feeds shared `Tone.Analyser` — both Spectrum and Resonance visualize live guitar/mic input.
- **MIDI input:** Web MIDI API via `midi-input.js`, Launchkey 49 auto-detect, keyboard size selector (25/49/61/88)
- **Chord lock-in:** freeze MIDI-detected chord for P/R/L transform exploration, sustain pedal toggle, chained transforms
- **Key-aware chord resolution:** ambiguous chords (aug/dim) resolve using diatonic context from KEY selector

- "You'll also hear this in..." related songs from song-examples.js
- Panel focus: steps can dim non-relevant panels or auto-switch to Rhythm tab
- Walkthroughs auto-capture progression for export to SkratchLab

### SkratchLab ✅ renamed + Rhythm Builder
- `/skratchlab` route (renamed from `/skratch-studio`)
- Top-level nav link alongside Explorer
- Interactive Rhythm Builder: 4×8 drum machine grid, preset patterns, Tone.js playback, export to Blockly blocks

## Not Started

See `docs/songlab-build-plan.md` (v4) for the full phased roadmap:

- **Phase A+:** Game visual unification (`game-shell.css` extraction, all games extend base.html) — partially complete (CSS extracted, templates unified, MIDI module landed)
- **Multi-chord glow worm paths** — visualize chord progressions/transitions with simultaneous paths showing voice leading (notes that stay vs. move)
- **SkratchLab lightweight DAW** — song presets, chord loops + rhythm, melody play-over, instrument selection (parallel to Phase B)
- **Phase B:** Extract `game-flow.js` (Pattern B adaptive, independent axes, ResultDetail schema), new games (Voice Leading Detective, Note Name Trainer, Interval Spotter, Chord Progression Builder, Rhythm Tapper, Melody Dictation). **Polyrhythm Trainer ✅ complete (B8)**
- **Phase B.5:** Auth & Persistence — Supabase auth, profile migration, ResultDetail → Supabase
- **Phase E5:** Competency Graph — fast path (B → B.5 → E5), cross-game skill tracking. CREPE pitch engine upgrade (Pro tier).
- **Phase C:** Curriculum paths, path runner UI, Tonnetz curriculum map
- **Phase D:** Differentiated experiences by user level
- **Phase E1–E4:** Per-game AI-powered feedback
- **Phase F:** Puzzle Paths, NoteInputProvider full abstraction (extends A++.6), Voicing Explorer advanced, social features
- **Architecture cleanup (from code review):** consolidate triplicated chord-type registries into transforms.js, replace `_suppressAutoPlay` with source-tagged HarmonyState.update(), standardize factory-function naming across detection modules

---

## Known Issues

- **Resonance defaults changed (April 20)** — Explorer's Resonance tab now renders sparkler-style by default, not the original starburst from April 19. Original aesthetic not preserved as a baked-in preset; consider adding it back as a named preset alongside "Defaults".
- **`/harmonograph` route is unlinked** — sandbox by design; visit `/harmonograph` directly (legacy `/art` redirects). Easy to forget the route exists. Decide on a front-door (footer link, easter egg, or remain hidden).
- **`pitch-detection.js` uses deprecated `ScriptProcessorNode`** — Chrome logs a deprecation warning. Functional for now. AudioWorklet migration tracked in `docs/audio-architecture.md` Open Question 1.
- **Swing Trainer 500 on production** — could not reproduce locally (April 17). Template extends base.html correctly. Likely Railway deploy state issue. Need fresh deploy + production stack trace capture. See `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md`.
- **Railway cold start** — ~15s first load after inactivity (hobby tier), warn testers
- **Rhythm Lab + Strum Patterns mic paths disabled** — dead route calls commented out, TODO points to onset-detection.js migration. Keyboard/spacebar input still works.
- **Harmony Trainer still uses server-side pitch detection** — `/process_audio_chunk` → librosa. Migration guide in `templates/harmony.html` comment block.
- **`_suppressAutoPlay` load-bearing** — 17 sites in explorer.html. Code review recommends source-tagged HarmonyState.update(). Deferred.
- **Triplicated chord-type registries** — transforms.js, chord-resolver.js, chord-detection.js. Consolidation into transforms.js recommended.
- **`/api/chat` proxy hardening** — model allowlist and server-side system prompt recommended. Not a blocker.
- Swing Trainer: dial slightly finicky past midpoint
- Swing Trainer: song-examples.js swing_ratio field not yet consumed by game
- SkratchLab Rhythm Builder: strum row doesn't export to Blockly (no strum block exists)
- Sustain pedal bug: Organ/Synth in SkratchLab — `triggerAttackRelease` bypasses sustain state
- Mobile/responsive not tested — deferred to post-MVP
- SkratchLab: "Clear All" button clears blocks but not canvas — needs canvas reset
- Polyrhythm Trainer not yet in nav dropdown or landing page
- Full list: `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md`
- **Backlog:** Enharmonic sharp/flat toggle for Fundamentals keyboards (deferred)
