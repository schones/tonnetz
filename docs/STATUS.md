## Current Focus

SongLab `dev` branch is feature-rich. Phase A, A++, and initial B8 complete. April 22 (later session) landed Stage 1 Prompt 1 of the `/art` torus/sphere 3D rendering: `mode3D` feature flag (off by default), 12×4 lattice on a (u, v)-parameterized torus-to-sphere morphable surface, manual rotation around three world axes, debug-panel sliders for `morph` / `torusMajorR/MinorR` / `rotSpeedX/Y/Z`. Nodes + edges only this prompt — triangles, back-face alpha, and particle behavior in 3D land in Prompt 2 and later. Same session also wired real audio input into `/art`: MIDI + Launchkey 49 + sustain pedal, chord + pitch detection in parallel, fixed two latent shared-module bugs (audio-input stale-source rewire and pitch-detection autoplay-policy suspension). Approaching user testing readiness.

**Next priorities:**
1. **Torus/sphere morph 3D — Stage 1 Prompt 2:** triangle rendering in 3D (Tonnetz triads on the curved surface) with back-face alpha so triangles on the far side fade rather than overlap the front. Two-pass painter's draw, optional later proper depth-sort. Continues in `resonance-art-view.js` + `templates/art.html`. After Prompt 2: particle reactivity in 3D, then Stage 1.5 multi-torus stacking, then Stage 2 audio-reactive morph.
2. SkratchLab polish — "Clear All" button should also reset canvas (not just blocks)
3. Add Polyrhythm Trainer to nav dropdown and landing page
4. Linus and Lucy walkthrough (connects from Polyrhythm Trainer)
5. Tab-audio capture experiment: feed YouTube into `/art`
6. Decide `/art` front-door (linked from nav, footer, hidden, or remain unlinked sandbox)
7. **Onboarding & tutorial UX** — Build a "guided tour" / tooltip-card system for the platform: friendly intro modals on first visit (Studio, Explorer, Games, `/art`), short walkthroughs explaining what each tool is for, and dedicated tutorials for the generative-art side (e.g., why the torus is the natural representation for a Tonnetz, how chord-triangles work, what the FFT is showing). Reference inspirations: BandLab's onboarding modals (sequential cards with X to dismiss, "There's more" / "Explore more" CTAs, large preview imagery, friendly first-name greeting). Could leverage existing walkthrough infrastructure from Explorer.
8. Consider preserving original "starburst" Resonance aesthetic as a named baked-in preset
9. Onset detection wired into Resonance for staccato burst behavior
10. Business model / monetization spec
11. game-flow.js + adaptive engine extraction (spec: `docs/game-engine-spec.md`)
12. SkratchLab lightweight DAW — song presets, chord loops + rhythm, melody play-over
13. Consolidate triplicated chord-type registries (code review finding)
14. Replace `_suppressAutoPlay` with source-tagged HarmonyState.update() (code review finding)
15. User testing prep (15-20 participants)

**Completed this cycle (April 22):**

- **Art Lab 3D rendering — Stage 1 Prompt 1 (nodes + edges on torus/sphere):**
  - `mode3D` feature flag in `DEFAULT_PARAMS` (default `false`); 2D path is bit-for-bit unchanged when off.
  - 3D lattice: 12 cols × 4 rows, nodes carry `(col, row, u, v, pc)` with `u = col·2π/12`, `v = row·2π/4`, PC formula unchanged. Each PC appears 4× on the surface. Edges wrap toroidally — every node has all six Tonnetz neighbors.
  - Parametric surfaces share `(u, v)`: torus `((R + r cos v) cos u, (R + r cos v) sin u, r sin v)` and sphere `(R cos v cos u, R cos v sin u, R sin v)`. Linear `morph ∈ [0, 1]` interpolates vertex positions.
  - World-axis rotation around X/Y/Z (Euler XYZ), three independent angular velocities. Default `rotSpeedY = 8 deg/s` so the shape is obviously 3D on first toggle.
  - Orthographic projection, scale fit `(R + r) → 70 %` of smaller canvas dim, computed in `_resize`.
  - `_buildGrid` and `_transformedNode` branch on `mode3D`; `_drawGrid` is unchanged. `setParam`/`setParams` rebuild the lattice when `mode3D` toggles.
  - Debug panel: new "3D Geometry" group with `mode3D` toggle, `morph`, torus radii, rotation speeds. Row builder extended to support `kind: 'toggle'` (checkbox + on/off readout).
  - Triangles deliberately empty in 3D mode — Prompt 2 adds them with back-face alpha. Particles in 3D look wrong (still spawn in 3D-projected screen space) — addressed in a later stage.

- **Art Lab audio infrastructure — real MIDI + mic input wired end-to-end:**
  - Unified held-notes tracker in `templates/art.html` merging four sources: on-screen keyboard, MIDI held notes, MIDI sustained notes, and detected chord/pitch events. Replaces prior source-agnostic append path with an additive multi-source model.
  - `KeyboardView.onNoteRelease` callback added symmetric to `onNotePlay`, routing on-screen keyboard releases through the tracker.
  - MIDI input via `midi-input.js` — Launchkey 49 auto-detects, drum channel 10 filtered. noteOn/noteOff routed through the sampler proxy in Tone's context.
  - Sustain pedal (CC 64) — pedal down defers `triggerRelease`, pedal up flushes. Standard piano semantics.
  - On-screen keyboard visibility toggle (hidden by default). `Keyboard` button in Hardware row toggles `.art-keyboard--hidden`. Preference in `localStorage['songlab.art.keyboardVisible']`. KeyboardView stays instantiated so sampler/analyser chain stays wired.

- **Chord + pitch detection wired into `/art`:**
  - `chord-detection.js` and `pitch-detection.js` both created and started together in `_updateAudioInputStatus` reconciliation (when `AudioInput.isActive && toneRunning`).
  - Parallel operation, not mutually exclusive. Pitch wins on confident monophonic input (`confidence >= 0.85`), chord takes over when pitch returns `frequency=0` (polyphonic / silence / ambiguous).
  - Silence watcher (100ms poll, 500ms quiet threshold) for chord-detection's edge-triggered emit model. Pitch-detection emits continuously, no watcher needed.
  - Root-first entry ordering in `_chordEventToEntries` so `_readHarmonyState`'s order-based role assignment colors root=gold, third=coral, fifth=blue correctly.

- **Audio-input routing bug fixed (latent, predates `/art`):**
  - Symptom: chord detection "working" during earlier testing was reading residual MIDI sampler audio, not mic — because the `_sourceNode` from `AudioInput`'s auto-restore (fallback-context path) was never successfully re-wired into Tone's context despite `AudioInput.isActive` reporting true.
  - Root cause: `setAnalyser()` tries to reconnect the stale cross-context source and silently fails, leaving state that breaks the subsequent `selectDevice`'s fresh connection.
  - Fix: explicit `AudioInput.disconnect()` before `setAnalyser` in `/art`'s `_attachAudioInputToTone`, so rewire starts from clean state. Contained to `templates/art.html`; shared `audio-input.js` refactor deferred.
  - **Resolves the April 19 "Scarlett 2i2 audio routing needs verification" known issue.**

- **`pitch-detection.js` autoplay-policy fix (shared module):**
  - Chrome starts programmatically-created `AudioContext` instances in `suspended` state. While suspended, `ScriptProcessorNode.onaudioprocess` does not fire — so YIN runs but sees no samples, and every callback returns `frequency: 0` below confidence.
  - Fix: `await audioContext.resume()` after construction in `pitch-detection.js:start()`. `resume()` is a no-op on already-running contexts, so callers that create the detector inside a user gesture (Melody Match) are unaffected. Callers that create it asynchronously (Art Lab via audio-input reconciliation) now get a running context and actual emissions.

- **Role preservation through decay tails (shared module):**
  - Previously `_readHarmonyState` reset every PC's role to `'root'` on every HarmonyState update; PCs decay over 2–3 seconds, during which they rendered in the wrong color (snapping to gold).
  - Fix: in `resonance-art-view.js`, reset role only for PCs about to be re-assigned this frame. Preserves prefer-lowest-index-role logic for same-frame multi-octave cases.

- **Triangle visibility + blob duration fix:**
  - `silentEps` default lowered from `0.001` to `0.0001` so quieter notes can cross the activity threshold.
  - New `triangleIntensityScale` parameter (default `100`), slider added to Chord Triangles panel. Intensity formula in `_drawTriangles` multiplies by the scale before `Math.min(1, ...)`.
  - Root cause: per-PC energy for a held triad is ~`0.003`, but the prior intensity formula assumed ~`1.0` energy so `alpha × intensity ≈ 0.003` rendered invisible.

**Completed previous cycle (April 20):**

- **Resonance debug panel (Explorer):**
  - URL-gated at `/explorer?debug=resonance`; production users see nothing
  - Refactored `resonance-view.js` constants → `DEFAULT_PARAMS` instance object with `getParams()` / `setParam()` / `setParams()` API; per-frame reads enable live tuning without reload
  - 22 tunable parameters across four sections (Smoothing & Decay, Particle Spawning, Particle Lifetime & Motion, Render & Glow)
  - Save / Export / Reset preset system with `localStorage['songlab.resonance.presets']`; export downloads dated JSON
  - Inline name-entry input replacing native `window.prompt()` (Chrome's narrow URL-bar prompt was unusable)
  - Viewport-fit panel layout with sticky header and internal slider scroll

- **Resonance bug fixes:**
  - Inverted blob fill (gradient was hollow at center) → center-bright with new `blobFillAlpha` tunable
  - Wiggle direction was global X/Y axes → now perpendicular to particle velocity
  - `PEAK_MAG_THRESHOLD` promoted from module constant to log-scale `peakMagThreshold` slider

- **Resonance default tuning baked in (sparkler aesthetic):**
  - New `particleDeceleration` parameter (default `0.95`)
  - 12 baseline values updated for short-life, low-velocity, high-spawn-rate, decelerating sparkler look
  - **Behavior change for end users:** Explorer's Resonance now renders sparkler-style by default, not starburst

- **`/art` sandbox route:**
  - New Flask route, new `templates/art.html`, new `static/shared/resonance-art-view.js` (verbatim fork of `resonance-view.js`, class `ResonanceArtView`)
  - Always-visible debug panel (Art Lab Tuning), independent preset namespace `localStorage['songlab.art.presets']`
  - Explorer's Resonance tab and `resonance-view.js` fully untouched by the fork

- **`/art` grid motion:**
  - Lattice rotates and sways as a rigid body around canvas center
  - Three tunables (`gridRotationSpeed`, `gridSwaySpeed`, `gridSwayAmplitude`), all default `0` so baseline unchanged until dialed in
  - Particles live in screen space — comet-trail effect on slow rotation

- **`/art` chord triangle highlights:**
  - Triangle list built at lattice setup (~48 triangles in 7×5 grid)
  - For each triangle, if all three vertex PCs are simultaneously active, render a gold fill + stroked outline with shadowBlur glow
  - Geometric truth emerges naturally: triads light one triangle, 7th chords light two adjacent triangles sharing an edge
  - Four tunables for fill/stroke/glow

- **`audio-input.js` cleanup (committed at session start):**
  - Extracted `_connectToAnalyser()` helper that prefers `Tone.connect()` for native-to-Tone wiring with a manual fallback
  - DRY'd up the analyser-swap path in the Hardware UI

**Completed previous cycle (April 19):**

- **Resonance tab (new Explorer panel):**
  - 6th Explorer stage tab: radial FFT spectrum visualization on Tonnetz grid
  - `static/shared/resonance-view.js` — ResonanceView class, 7×5 Tonnetz lattice
  - Each active node renders the FFT spectrum wrapped in a circle — frequency → angle, magnitude → radius
  - HarmonyState gates which nodes render, FFT drives how they look. No synthetic fallback — pure audio-driven.
  - Chord-function coloring: gold (root), coral (third), blue (fifth), green (seventh)
  - Particles spawn from FFT peaks, radiate outward, dynamics matched to Spectrum panel
  - Fullscreen toggle on both Spectrum and Resonance tabs

- **Audio interface wiring (Explorer):**
  - `audio-input.js` connected to Explorer with Hardware UI (device dropdown, status, quality badge)
  - Scarlett 2i2 auto-detect, MediaStreamSource feeds shared `Tone.Analyser`
  - Both Spectrum and Resonance read live external audio
  - Fixed Tone.js cross-context node connection error

- **Polyrhythm Trainer tweaks:**
  - Hit zone moved up (HIT_Y 370→280), post-hit effects area below
  - Audio gain chain (layerGain → masterGain) eliminates overlap on changes
  - Lane waves + missed notes extend below hit zone with fade-out

- **Bug fixes:**
  - Quality name mismatch between chord-resolver.js and transforms.js (dim→diminished, aug→augmented, etc.)
  - TypeError in _notesFromTriad when triadNotes returned null for unrecognized qualities
  - Tonnetz crash (buildNeighborhood) on unrecognized chord types — try/catch guard added
  - kv-key--midi missing CSS → changed MIDI source to 'user' for existing highlight styles
  - Duplicate audio on MIDI chord detection → _suppressAutoPlay wrapper
  - Keyboard octave jump on chord detection → manual HarmonyState.update with real MIDI octaves

**Completed previous cycle (April 9-13):**

- **Project rename (April 13):** Tonnetz → SongLab across GitHub, Railway, CLAUDE.md, README.md, doc filenames, cross-references. Music theory "Tonnetz" references preserved.

- **Extended chord support (April 13):**
  - `CHORD_TYPES` dictionary in transforms.js: triads, 7ths (dom7/maj7/min7/dim7/half-dim7/minmaj7), sus (sus2/sus4/7sus4), extended (add9/dom9/maj9/min9)
  - `chordPCs`, `chordNotes`, `baseTriad`, `extensionNotes`, `chordSymbol` utility functions
  - HarmonyState: `activeChord` field, `setChord()`, `highlightChord()`, chordType-aware `setProgressionIndex()`
  - Keyboard extension rendering: gold ring highlights, interval labels (♭7, 7, etc.)
  - Tonnetz extension nodes: glowing nodes + dashed connectors for notes beyond the triad
  - Chord labels: `activeChord.symbol` preferred ("B7", "Cmaj7") across Explorer + Tonnetz
  - Folsom Prison, Johnny B. Goode, ii-V-I, Lean On Me walkthroughs updated with chordType

- **Phase E5:** Competency Graph — fast path (B → B.5 → E5), cross-game skill tracking. CREPE pitch engine upgrade (Pro tier).
- **Phase C:** Curriculum paths, path runner UI, Tonnetz curriculum map
- **Phase D:** Differentiated experiences by user level
- **Phase E1–E4:** Per-game AI-powered feedback
- **Phase F:** Puzzle Paths, NoteInputProvider full abstraction (extends A++.6), Voicing Explorer advanced, social features
- **Architecture cleanup (from code review):** consolidate triplicated chord-type registries into transforms.js, replace `_suppressAutoPlay` with source-tagged HarmonyState.update(), standardize factory-function naming across detection modules

## Known Issues

- **Resonance defaults changed (April 20)** — Explorer's Resonance tab now renders sparkler-style by default, not the original starburst from April 19. Original aesthetic not preserved as a baked-in preset; consider adding it back as a named preset alongside "Defaults".
- **`/art` route is unlinked** — sandbox by design; visit `/art` directly. Easy to forget the route exists. Decide on a front-door (footer link, easter egg, or remain hidden).
- **`pitch-detection.js` uses deprecated `ScriptProcessorNode`** — Chrome logs a deprecation warning. Functional for now. AudioWorklet migration tracked in `docs/audio-architecture.md` Open Question 1.
- **Swing Trainer 500 on production** — could not reproduce locally (April 17). Template extends base.html correctly. Likely Railway deploy state issue. Need fresh deploy + production stack trace capture. See `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md`.
- **Railway cold start** — ~15s first load after inactivity (hobby tier), warn testers
- **Rhythm Lab + Strum Patterns mic paths disabled** — dead route calls commented out, TODO points to onset-detection.js migration. Keyboard/spacebar input still works.
- **Harmony Trainer still uses server-side pitch detection** — `/process_audio_chunk` → librosa. Migration guide in `templates/harmony.html` comment block.
- **`_suppressAutoPlay` load-bearing** — 17 sites in explorer.html. Code review recommends source-tagged HarmonyState.update(). Deferred.
- **Triplicated chord-type registries** — transforms.js, chord-resolver.js, chord-detection.js. Consolidation into transforms.js recommended.
- **`/api/chat` proxy hardening** — model allowlist and server-side system prompt recommended. Not a blocker.
- Swing Trainer: dial slightly finicky past midpoint
- Swing Trainer: song-examples.js swing_ratio field not yet consumed by game
- SkratchLab Rhythm Builder: strum row doesn't export to Blockly (no strum block exists)
- Sustain pedal bug: Organ/Synth in SkratchLab — `triggerAttackRelease` bypasses sustain state
- Mobile/responsive not tested — deferred to post-MVP
- SkratchLab: "Clear All" button clears blocks but not canvas — needs canvas reset
- Polyrhythm Trainer not yet in nav dropdown or landing page
- Full list: `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md`
- **Backlog:** Enharmonic sharp/flat toggle for Fundamentals keyboards (deferred)
