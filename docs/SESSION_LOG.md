## 2026-04-01 evening — Showcase Page

- Designed and planned `/showcase` feature tour page — standalone scrolling page to make the product's features immediately obvious to visitors (especially teachers)
- Explored Google Stitch (Google Labs AI design tool, March 2026 update) as a design workflow tool
- Used Stitch in Thinking mode (Gemini 3.1 Pro) to generate a full-page design comp from a detailed prompt + 6 app screenshots
- Stitch output: section layouts, annotation styles for Explorer panels, game cards grid, glassmorphism labels, scroll pacing — exported as HTML/CSS + DESIGN.md + screen.png
- Decided: showcase uses real screenshots with annotation overlays, not AI-generated mockups or stylized illustrations
- Decided: page lives at `/showcase` within the app (not a separate site)
- Decided: Stitch export used as visual reference/design spec — Claude Code builds the actual Jinja2 template to fit Flask/Jinja2 stack
- Stitch design system ("Harmonic Resonance"): deep indigo background (#111125), lavender/purple interactive elements, amber/orange highlights, glassmorphism panels, Plus Jakarta Sans/Manrope/Inter typography, "no-line" sectioning philosophy, glow borders
- Page structure finalized: Hero → Explorer (annotated 4-panel screenshot + C major→A minor before/after) → Games "Mastery through Play" (Intro→Practice→Test pill + 4 game cards) → Skratch Studio (split layout with real screenshot) → Real Songs You Know (3 progression cards from song-examples.js) → Footer CTA
- Created Claude Code build prompt (`claude-code-prompt-showcase.md`) with full technical spec
- Decided: no explicit "for teachers" pitch section — if the showcase is done right, teachers will naturally want to use it
- Decided: "Real Songs" section pulls from the 67-entry song-examples.js database
- Decided: annotations hide on mobile, game cards responsive (4→2→1 col)
- Stitch export saved to `stitch-export/` in repo (code.html, DESIGN.md, screen.png)
- Next: full component walkthrough tomorrow, capture remaining screenshots (Explorer with A minor selected), run Claude Code build prompt, iterate on result

## 2026-04-01 late night

- Built Swing Trainer game (`static/games/swing-trainer.html`) — Tonnetz's first dedicated rhythm ear-training game
- Core engine: Tone.js swing sequencer, Ab major ostinato, swing ratio stored in ref variable (real-time knob → audio with no transport restart)
- Waveform visualization: Gaussian pulse train showing swing ratio geometrically — upbeat pulse migrates right as ratio increases
- Knob control: SVG rotary dial, 270° travel, vertical drag, three unlabeled detent markers at 50%/67%/75%
- Four-phase game loop: Listen (target groove plays 4 measures) → Match (straight 4/4 starts, knob live) → Lock In → Reveal (waveform overlay + score)
- Practice mode: ghost groove continues under match phase, waveform visible, generous scoring
- Test mode: groove stops after listen, no waveform during match, tight scoring
- Progressive scoring: Locked in / Close / In the pocket / Keep listening — thresholds differ by mode
- Session streak counter (consecutive "Locked in" results), resets on anything below Close
- Added to Tonnetz: Flask route, nav entry, card #8 in Practice Games grid with RHYTHM tag
- Updated song-examples.js to v1.1: added RHYTHM — SWING FEEL section with 6 new entries (bossa_nova_straight, lite_swing_scarborough, medium_swing_st_louis, triplet_swing_guaraldi, hard_bop_minnie, shuffle_blues_rising_sun), added swing_ratio field to demo schema
- Decided: Practice/Test mode toggle locked per session, not per round
- Decided: straight 4/4 starts immediately at 50% in match phase (Practice) or random position (Test)
- Decided: BPM fixed at 80 for now, BPM control to be added next session
- Decided: games page section restructure (Harmony/Rhythm/Explorer) deferred — Swing Trainer added as flat card with RHYTHM tag for now
- Decided: Swing Trainer is standalone for now, not wired to HarmonyState
- Known issues: dial slightly finicky past midpoint (deferred), swing_ratio field in song-examples not yet consumed by game
- Reminders set: (1) add BPM control to swing trainer, (2) consume swing_ratio in game from song-examples, (3) security review + backend proxy check before production push

## 2026-03-31 morning

- Chapter 4 rebuild on Explorer components: Claude Code (Opus) built initial version, but Tonnetz container ID mismatch + Tone.js not loaded caused errors. Opus session hit 0% context — killed and restarted with focused fix prompt on Sonnet.
- Designed and queued full MVP polish sprint (4 prompts total):
  - Post-onboarding routing: preset → destination mapping (beginner→/intro, dabbler→/intro/2, producer→/intro/3, curious_player→/intro/4, deep_diver→/explorer, math_explorer→/explorer)
  - End-of-chapter "What's Next" cards: contextual game/theory links for all 5 chapters, shared component
  - First-visit dismissible banners for Explorer and Skratch Studio (tracked in localStorage profile)
  - Nav cleanup: Games dropdown (all 6 games), Skratch Studio link, active state highlighting
  - Returning user index state: "Continue Chapter N" / "Course complete" replaces "Start Here" card
- All 4 prompts executed (Sonnet). Banners confirmed working. Other items need verification next session.
- Decided: Supabase deferred to post-MVP. localStorage sufficient for initial user testing round.
- Decided: Mobile/responsive deferred to post-MVP.
- Decided: Use Sonnet for Claude Code builds, Opus for planning/design/review.
- Phase A confirmed fully complete (A1–A5 all done as of yesterday, STATUS.md was stale).
- Updated STATUS.md and SESSION_LOG.md.
- Next: verify all polish changes, fretboard polish, end-to-end new-user walkthrough, deploy.

## 2026-03-30 afternoon

- Full docs update: applied 15-issue cross-reference audit from Friday to all md files
- Created voicing-explorer-spec.md v0.3 (was missing from repo)
- Archived old doc versions in docs/archive/
- Removed stale AGENT_GUIDE.md
- Fixed glow worm blur bleeding over Tonnetz node labels (SVG render order + blur reduction)
- Started A4 Session 1: multi-path glow worm progression engine (running in Claude Code)
- Decided: A4 lives at /theory/chord-progressions as lesson page embedding Explorer panels
- Decided: animated playthrough with fading trails (not all-at-once)
- Decided: Song Examples DB integration with dual tabs — "By Pattern" + "By Song"
- Decided: common-tone flash during chord transitions (white/gold pulse, ~500ms)
- Workflow: Sonnet as default Claude Code model, Opus for multi-file architectural prompts
- Tested progression engine, Session 2 (page UI), A3 modes, fretboard panel
- Theory pages are wired into dropdown nav

## 2026-03-29 (Saturday)

- Voicing Explorer MVP build session — shipped Note Mode, glow worm path, ChordResolver, 3-panel sync
- 474 insertions across 5 modified files + 2 new modules (chord-bubble-renderer.js, chord-resolver.js)
- Decided: glow worm over convex hull (encodes voicing order)
- Decided: chord wheel arc re-centers on assembled chord's key as tonic
- Decided: ChordResolver enhanced HarmonyState rather than separate detection
- Ideas captured: multiple simultaneous glow worm paths, chord shapes as Skratch Studio blocks

## 2026-03-27 (Friday evening)

- Full spec cross-reference audit: 15 issues identified across all docs
- Created voicing-explorer-spec.md v0.3 (MVP scope, composable panels, resolved open questions)
- Updated all docs with fixes (orientation, 4→3 panels, phase numbering, Song DB status)
- Decided: "tools teachers find useful" positioning (not teacher dashboard)
- Decided: alternative voicings = killer use case for working musicians
- Decided: fretboard panel as pre-MVP composable panel
- Decided: game-flow.js extraction at Phase B start
- Note: doc updates weren't committed until 2026-03-30 — need to close this loop faster

## 2026-03-27 (Thursday)

- Phase A1 complete: Circle of Fifths page at /theory/circle-of-fifths
- Phase A2 complete: Tonal Centers lesson at /theory/tonal-centers (4-step walkthrough + ear training)
- Debugged: playBtn.disabled state not resetting, audioReady toggle issue
- Backend API proxy confirmed complete and secure
- Decided: defer auth/persistence to Phase B.5 as planned

## 2026-03-23

- Visual layer system built (visual-config.js, visual-layer.js, visual-toggle.js)
- Replaced sprint tracker with MVP tracker
- Updated STATUS.md as source of truth
